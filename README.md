Methodic is an extension to the [Unity game engine](http://unity3d.com/)
allowing a component's methods to be triggered manually from a GUI. This makes
it easy to test code in the editor and during gameplay.

The package can be purchased and downloaded from the
[Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/content/matthew-miner/methodic/1Xw). If
you're short on cash feel welcome to grab the code directly from here.
