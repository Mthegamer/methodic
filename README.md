Methodic is an editor extension for Unity (the
[game engine](http://unity3d.com/)) allowing a component's methods to be
triggered manually from a handy GUI window. This makes it easy to test code in
the editor and during gameplay.

A package can be purchased and downloaded from the
[Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/content/matthew-miner/methodic/1Xw).
