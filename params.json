Programmers and level designers alike can use it to quickly test new methods and invoke oft-used ones. As a bonus, functions execute both when the game is playing and when it isn't, allowing routines written specifically for batch editor jobs to be easily run. Nice.\r\n\r\nMethodic is available for purchase on the Unity Asset Store. Ten bucks and this marvel of modern C# is yours to enjoy. The source code is also downloadable from GitHub if you lack the cash to purchase it.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and opening the Methodic package in Unity, open the editor window from, appropriately, the *Window* menu. Select a game object with your custom component attached and its methods will show up. Select one, enter parameter values if desired, and hit \"Invoke\". The function will execute as if called from elsewhere in the script.\r\n\r\n_(to do: write more thorough documentation)_"}
