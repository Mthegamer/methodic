Methodic
========

Methodic provides an editor window for executing functions defined in
components attached to game objects. This can be used to manually trigger
events during gameplay or to modify game objects in the editor.

Open the Methodic window by selecting the Window > Methodic menu. For additional
information on using Methodic, refer to the included Getting Started guide.


Known Limitations
-----------------
Methodic currently lacks support for array parameters. In such cases, a null
value is sent when the function in invoked. This also happens when the
parameter type is unrecognized; say, if it's a class of your own creation.
