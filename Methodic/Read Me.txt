Methodic
========

Methodic provides a GUI for executing functions defined in a game object's
components. This can be used to manually trigger events during gameplay and to
modify game objects in the editor.

Open the Methodic window by selecting the Window > Methodic menu. For additional
information on using Methodic please refer to the included Getting Started
guide.


Known Limitations
-----------------
Currently Methodic does not support array parameters. In such cases a value of
null is sent when the function in invoked. This happens also when the parameter
type is unrecognized; say, if it's a class of your own creation.
